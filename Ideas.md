## Doubts
* What is cannonical form?
* Make a list of examples which cover all edge cases

## Tasks
* Take inputs as minterm
* Apply McCluskey's algorithm using minterm & get the answer in SOP
* Print the SOP result

## Extras
* Convert maxterm to minterm
* Convert SOP to POS
* Make the code work for don't care conditions
* Can any additional optimisations be done to the algorithm to reduce the logic function further or speed up the code?
* Implelemt XOR and XNOR representations of the output (like A'B+AB' to A^B and so on for multiple inputs)
